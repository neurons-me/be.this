# BE.THIS 

Imagine the npm modules "this.be" and "be.this" as dynamic entities in the realm of JavaScript, with each having its own defined role in a system.

**this.be:** The State Guardian

It represents the heart of your application, maintaining a global state or context.
Every time there's a change, or when specific events occur, "this.be" takes note and acts as the guardian of that state, ensuring that it's accessible and known.

**be.this:** The State Enforcer

This module is the action-taker, adjusting and reconfiguring based on the state preserved by "this.be".
Think of it as a troubleshooter or a healer; it watches the state and acts when things aren't in harmony with it.
To conceptualize this in code:

```js
// this.be: State Guardian
const state = {
    value: 0
};

function updateState(newValue) {
    state.value = newValue;
    beThis.fixState(state);
}

// be.this: State Enforcer
const beThis = {
    desiredState: 10,
    fixState: function(currentState) {
        if (currentState.value !== this.desiredState) {
            console.log("State is not aligned! Fixing...");
            currentState.value = this.desiredState;
            console.log("State fixed to:", currentState.value);
        } else {
            console.log("State is perfect!");
        }
    }
};

// Using the modules
updateState(5);   // "State is not aligned! Fixing..." & "State fixed to: 10"
updateState(10);  // "State is perfect!"
```



In this simple example, "this.be" maintains a state and "be.this" ensures the system adjusts to keep the state in harmony with its defined desiredState. As the application evolves, you could expand the functionalities of each module, but this core interaction remains at the heart of their symbiotic relationship.
